# StudentGradeCalculator

This is a C# project that calculates a student's average grade based on Users inputted grades.  
It asks for the student's name and grades, then prints the average.

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter the student's name.
2. The user inputs the number of grades to be calculated.
3. The program validates that the number of grades is a positive integer.
4. The user is asked to enter each grade one by one.
5. If an invalid (negative or non-numeric) grade is entered, the program prompts the user again.
6. The program calculates the average of the grades and displays the result.

## Features:
- Calculates average automatically
- Validates input to ensure only positive numbers are entered.
- Uses loops to prevent incorrect input.
- Formats the average to two decimal places.

## How to Run:
1. Open the project in Visual Studio or any C# IDE.
2. Compile and run the program.
